Login and Registration System (C++)

This project is a Login and Registration System developed in C++, designed to simulate a basic user authentication process. The system allows users to register a new account, log in using existing credentials, and validates user input to ensure correct authentication.

User data such as username and password is stored and retrieved using file handling, making the system persistent across multiple runs. The project demonstrates important C++ concepts including file I/O, conditional statements, loops, and basic security logic.

This project helps in understanding how real-world authentication systems work at a basic level while strengthening problem-solving and logical thinking skills in C++.
